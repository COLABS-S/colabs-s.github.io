title: BNL listening session scheduled for Thursday 24 August
---

Our BNL listening session will be held 2:00pm -- 3:00pm ET on Teams, hosted by Meifeng Lin.  Please [email us](mailto:colabs@lists.mcs.anl.gov?subject=BNL listening session) for the Teams link or other questions.

Note that while the current initiative from DOE is focused primarily on ASCR-funded, ECP ST, and ECP co-design software products, COLABS is designed to serve research software projects from any sponsor.  As such, we would welcome the opportunity to speak with leaders of ECP AD projects as well as those supported by DOE offices other than ASCR (including both Office of Science and applied offices).
