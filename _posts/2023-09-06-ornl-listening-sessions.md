title: ORNL listening sessions scheduled for Wednesday 6 September and Friday 8 September
---

Our ORNL listening sessions will be held 9:30am -- 11:00am ET Wednesday 6 September and 1:00pm -- 2:30pm ET Friday 8 September on Zoom, hosted by David Bernholdt.  Please [email us](mailto:colabs@lists.mcs.anl.gov?subject=ORNL listening session) for the Zoom link or other questions.

Note that while the current initiative from DOE is focused primarily on ASCR-funded, ECP ST, and ECP co-design software products, COLABS is designed to serve research software projects from any sponsor.  As such, we would welcome the opportunity to speak with leaders of ECP AD projects as well as those supported by DOE offices other than ASCR (including both Office of Science and applied offices).
