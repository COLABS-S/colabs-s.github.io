title: LBNL listening session scheduled for Friday 18 August
---

Our LBNL listening session will be held 10:00am - 11:00am PT in 59-3-3054-CR and on Zoom, hosted by Dan Gunter.  Please [email us](mailto:colabs@lists.mcs.anl.gov?subject=LBNL listening session) for Zoom link or other questions.

Note that while the current initiative from DOE is focused primarily on ASCR-funded, ECP ST, and ECP co-design software products, COLABS is designed to serve research software projects from any sponsor.  As such, we would welcome the opportunity to speak with leaders of ECP AD projects as well as those supported by DOE offices other than ASCR (including both Office of Science and applied offices).

## Agenda

- Brief (5-10 min) review of ASCR SW Sustainability and COLABS - Dan Gunter
- High-level questions to projects, responses from group (30-40 min)
- Open discussion (10-20 min)
