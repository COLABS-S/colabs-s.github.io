title: COLABS listening sessions coming soon to a laboratory near you!
---

The COLABS team will be organizing a series of "listening sessions" with interested software projects so that we can better understand the community's hopes and needs for the stewardship of their software.  If you're interested in talking with us about *your* software project's needs, please reach out to your [local COLABS representative](https://colabs-science.github.io/#who-are-we) or if you're not at a COLABS member institution, please [email us](mailto:colabs@lists.mcs.anl.gov?subject=Listening sessions).
