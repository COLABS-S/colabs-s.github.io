title: COLABS listening sessions coming soon to a laboratory near you!
---

The COLABS team will be organizing a series of "listening sessions" with interested software projects so that we can better understand the community's hopes and needs for the stewardship of their software.  If you're interested in talking with us about *your* software project's needs, please reach out to your [local COLABS representative](https://colabs-science.github.io/#who-are-we) or if you're not at a COLABS member institution, please [email us](mailto:colabs@lists.mcs.anl.gov?subject=Listening sessions).

Note that while the current initiative from DOE is focused primarily on ASCR-funded, ECP ST, and ECP co-design software products, COLABS is designed to serve research software projects from any sponsor.  As such, we would welcome the opportunity to speak with leaders of ECP AD projects as well as those supported by DOE offices other than ASCR (including both Office of Science and applied offices).
